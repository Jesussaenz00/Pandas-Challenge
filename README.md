# Pandas-Challenge

In this challenge I was given two datasets that included information about key performance indicators between schools from certain city.

The datasets include total students enrolled, total budget, budget per capita, type of school, genders, average scores according to the course and what grade are they in. 

The challenge included many variables to compare between the schools, in the document you can find a wide number of tables that show the characteristics of each of them. Not only did I create table to show the information, but I also included two tables that show the top 5 and top bottom schools; according to their overall performance in grades. 

After finishing with the calculations, you can see the data stored in the following way:
- Highest-Performing Schools
- Bottom-Performing Schools
- Math Scores by Grade
- Reading Scores by Grade
- Scores by School Spending
- Scores by School Size
- Scores by School Type

To be done with the exercise I decided that it was interesting to point out that school size does matter, as I was able to see the information, the most concerning fact from the table in the line number [291], containing that the % overall passing score in a school with a higher student size is not even close to be 60 with a total of 53.67. Versus a small student number with an % overall passing of 89.88.
